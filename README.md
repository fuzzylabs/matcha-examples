# Welcome to `matcha` examples!

This repository contains a whole suite of example workflows which can be used in conjunction with `matcha`. The repository currently contains the following examples:

* Movie recommendation
* Legal text summarisation using LLMs

Before you dive into the examples, each require some resources provisioned in the cloud - Azure specifically.

First, move into the example directory that you're wanting to explore (we'll use the recommendation one as an example):

```bash
cd recommendation
```

Now, to provision a set of default infrastructure, run the following:

```bash
matcha provision
```

Once that's complete, dive into the example workflows!

> You'll need the right level of permissions on your Azure account - see here.

If you're wondering what on earth `matcha` is, it's a tool we've developed to easily provision MLOps tooling into the cloud. To learn more about `matcha` and to get started, check out the following:
